# Joints of the Human Hand

The human hand contains 21 distinct joints, each with specific anatomical names. These joints facilitate a wide range of movements, from precise finger motions to the complex movements of the wrist and thumb. Below is a comprehensive list of all 21 joints in the hand, categorized by their location and function.

## 1. Wrist Joints

### Radiocarpal Joint
- **Location:** Between the distal end of the radius (one of the forearm bones) and the proximal row of carpal bones (scaphoid and lunate).
- **Function:** Allows flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the wrist.

### Midcarpal Joint
- **Location:** Between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones.
- **Function:** Facilitates complex wrist movements by allowing gliding between the carpal bones.

## 2. Carpometacarpal (CMC) Joints

There are five Carpometacarpal joints, each connecting a carpal bone to a metacarpal bone:

### Trapezium-Metacarpal Joint (Thumb CMC)
- **Location:** Between the trapezium (a carpal bone) and the first metacarpal (thumb).
- **Function:** Enables the thumb’s wide range of motion, including opposition.

### Trapezoid-Metacarpal Joint (Index Finger CMC)
- **Location:** Between the trapezoid (a carpal bone) and the second metacarpal (index finger).
- **Function:** Provides stability and limited movement to the index finger.

### Capitate-Metacarpal Joint (Middle Finger CMC)
- **Location:** Between the capitate (a carpal bone) and the third metacarpal (middle finger).
- **Function:** Offers limited gliding movements for the middle finger.

### Hamate-Metacarpal Joint (Little Finger CMC)
- **Location:** Between the hamate (a carpal bone) and the fifth metacarpal (little finger).
- **Function:** Allows slight movements to accommodate finger flexion and extension.

### Lunate-Metacarpal Joint (Ring Finger CMC)
- **Location:** Between the lunate (a carpal bone) and the fourth metacarpal (ring finger).
- **Function:** Provides stability with minimal movement for the ring finger.

## 3. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joints

There are five Metacarpophalangeal joints, each connecting a metacarpal bone to a proximal phalanx (the first bone of the finger):

### First Metacarpophalangeal Joint (Thumb MCP)
- **Location:** Between the first metacarpal and the proximal phalanx of the thumb.
- **Function:** Allows flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and opposition of the thumb.

### Second Metacarpophalangeal Joint (Index Finger MCP)
- **Location:** Between the second metacarpal and the proximal phalanx of the index finger.
- **Function:** Facilitates flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the index finger.

### Third Metacarpophalangeal Joint (Middle Finger MCP)
- **Location:** Between the third metacarpal and the proximal phalanx of the middle finger.
- **Function:** Enables flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the middle finger.

### Fourth Metacarpophalangeal Joint (Ring Finger MCP)
- **Location:** Between the fourth metacarpal and the proximal phalanx of the ring finger.
- **Function:** Allows flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the ring finger.

### Fifth Metacarpophalangeal Joint (Little Finger MCP)
- **Location:** Between the fifth metacarpal and the proximal phalanx of the little finger.
- **Function:** Facilitates flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the little finger.

## 4. Interphalangeal (IP) Joints

These joints connect the phalanges (finger bones) to each other. There are two types for each finger (proximal and distal) and one for the thumb:

### For the Fingers (Index, Middle, Ring, Little):

#### Proximal Interphalangeal Joint of the Index Finger
- **Location:** Between the proximal and middle phalanges of the index finger.
- **Function:** Allows bending and straightening of the finger.

#### Distal Interphalangeal Joint of the Index Finger
- **Location:** Between the middle and distal phalanges of the index finger.
- **Function:** Enables fine bending and straightening movements.

#### Proximal Interphalangeal Joint of the Middle Finger
- **Location:** Between the proximal and middle phalanges of the middle finger.
- **Function:** Facilitates bending and straightening of the finger.

#### Distal Interphalangeal Joint of the Middle Finger
- **Location:** Between the middle and distal phalanges of the middle finger.
- **Function:** Allows for fine bending and straightening movements.

#### Proximal Interphalangeal Joint of the Ring Finger
- **Location:** Between the proximal and middle phalanges of the ring finger.
- **Function:** Enables bending and straightening of the finger.

#### Distal Interphalangeal Joint of the Ring Finger
- **Location:** Between the middle and distal phalanges of the ring finger.
- **Function:** Allows fine bending and straightening movements.

#### Proximal Interphalangeal Joint of the Little Finger
- **Location:** Between the proximal and middle phalanges of the little finger.
- **Function:** Facilitates bending and straightening of the finger.

#### Distal Interphalangeal Joint of the Little Finger
- **Location:** Between the middle and distal phalanges of the little finger.
- **Function:** Enables fine bending and straightening movements.

### For the Thumb:

#### Interphalangeal Joint of the Thumb
- **Location:** Between the proximal and distal phalanges of the thumb.
- **Function:** Allows bending and straightening of the thumb.

## Notes
- **Carpometacarpal (CMC) Joints:** The CMC joints, especially the thumb CMC joint (trapezium-metacarpal), are highly mobile and allow for the opposable movement of the thumb, which is crucial for grasping objects.
- **Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joints:** These joints are condyloid type joints, allowing movement in multiple planes, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction.
- **Interphalangeal (IP) Joints:** These are hinge type joints, primarily allowing for flexion and extension. The fingers (index, middle, ring, little) have both proximal and distal IP joints, while the thumb has only one IP joint.

Understanding the anatomy of these joints is essential for comprehending hand mechanics, diagnosing injuries, and performing medical or therapeutic interventions.
